The ProcessManager and helpers are in classes
MigratableProcess interface is in interfaces
MigratableProcess implmentations are in processes

To run:
cd into classes,
make clean
make
Then run java ProcessManager on the master
and java ProcessManager -c <hostName> on each of the slaves

The provided Processes:
TestMigratableProcess <infile> <outFile>
	Copies infile to outfile one line at a time, waiting
	1 second between lines.

RhymeProcess <infile> <outfile> <serialized rhyme dictionary file>
	Sorts infile into outfile by each lines last words rhyme.
	The serialized rhyme dictionary file is provided: rhymeMap.ser
	NOTE: this process should not be churned between nodes as each time
	it resumes execution it has to reload the dictionary file which can
	take 30 seconds.

	example call: "RhymeProcess in.txt out.txt rhymeMap.ser"

MeterCheckProcess <infile> <outfile> <serialized meter dictionary file>
	For every line in the infile, write a line to the outfile
	which contains the spoken meter of the original line.
	The serialized dictionary file is provided: meterMap.ser
	NOTE: Also shouldn't be churned between nodes for the same reason
	as above.
	
	example call: "MeterCheckProcess in.txt out.txt meterMap.ser"

Also provided is an in.txt file which contains a few sonnets that can be read
and checked for rhyme and meter. (source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/sonnet-examples.html)
