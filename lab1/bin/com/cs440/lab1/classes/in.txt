Turn back the heart you've turned away
Give back your kissing breath
Leave not my love as you have left
The broken hearts of yesterday
But wait, be still, don't lose this way
Affection now, for what you guess
May be something more, could be less
Accept my love, live for today
Your roses wilted, as love spurned
Yet trust in me, my love and truth
Dwell in my heart, from which you've turned
My strength as great as yours aloof
It is in fear you turn away
And miss the chance of love today

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer's lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee
